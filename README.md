# Cloning wesite using React

Recreated website using React, incorporating React Router for navigation and Helmet for SEO. Employing hooks like useState and useEffect, I ensured efficient state management and side effect handling. Utilized JSX, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance the user interface and interactivity. This project, hosted on my GitHub repository, demonstrates my dedication to learning React and showcases my ability to work with modern web development technologies.
